You can now link your local or server-hosted Hoppscotch instance to the desktop app, by simply configuring your instance's URL.

- Launch the Desktop app and enter the URL of your self-hosted Hoppscotch instance. This can be the local environment URL (e.g., `localhost`) or a custom domain for a server-hosted instance (e.g. `hoppscotch.company.com`).
- Once the URL is entered, it will be verified for validity. If the connection is successful, it will be added to your list of **Recent Connections** for easy access.
- You can also **pin** your most frequently used instances for faster navigation.
- After establishing a successful connection, the Hoppscotch interface will load, providing you with full access to the app connected to your self-hosted instance.
