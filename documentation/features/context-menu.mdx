Context-aware menus enable quick actions like creating variables or adding query
parameters by selecting text or elements. The context menu offers three options:
**Set as Variable**, **Add to Parameters**, and **Open Request in New Tab**.

<Info>
  The "Add to Parameters" option is available only when using query parameters.

## Set as Variable

You can access the **Set as Variable** option from the context menu. Once
selected, you can assign the selected value to an environment variable.

Hoppscotch offers different variable scopes, including global, environment, and
request variables. You can read more about variable scopes
[here](/documentation/features/variables).

### How to Use "Set as Variable"

After setting an [environment variable](/documentation/features/environments),
you can use it with the format `<<variable name>>`. This allows you to store
values like `<<baseURL>>` in a single variable.

## Add to Parameters

The **Add to Parameters** option lets you easily add parameters and their
values.

When you select **Add to Parameters**, it automatically captures the parameter
and its value. For example, the `baseURL` is
`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/?user=1` now the user with ID "1" will be
included in the parameter placeholder.

## Open Request in New Tab

The **Open Request in New Tab** option allows you to open the current request in
a new tab, enabling you to handle multiple requests simultaneously.

This feature helps you shift the current request to a new tab while working on a
new request in the original tab.
