Request Headers are key-value pairs that the client sends to the server with an HTTP request. These headers carry extra details about your request, helping the server understand its context and tailor the response to fit.

## Headers Tab

In Hoppscotch, you can easily set and manage request headers using the **Headers tab**. This tab allows you to define **`key-value`** pairs, and you can also add a **`description`** for each header to keep track of its purpose.

Here are a few common headers you might set:

| **Header**        | **Description**                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authorization** | Used for passing credentials, such as tokens, to authenticate the client with the server. |
| **Content-Type**  | Indicates the format of the data being sent, like `application/json`.                     |
| **Accept**        | Tells the server what media types the client can handle in the response.                  |
| **Cache-Control** | Controls caching behavior in both requests and responses.                                 |
| **User-Agent**    | Provides information about the client making the request.                                 |

Hoppscotch offers a variety of header options beyond these five examples, allowing you to customize how the server processes your requests to meet specific requirements.
