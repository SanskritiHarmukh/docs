## Connecting to a GraphQL server

Switch to the GraphQL platform on Hoppscotch and connect to the below GraphQL server.

```
https://echo.hoppscotch.io/graphql
```

Once a successful connection has been made, you can view both **documentation** and the **schema** using Hoppscotch.

It is important to explore the schema to understand the different **queries, mutations, types, and subscriptions** that are offered by the endpoint.

## Running the query

You can execute queries to retrieve data from the GraphQL server by following these steps:

- Navigate to the **Queries** subsection in the **Documentation** panel.
- Select a query to automatically populate the Query editor with a structured template, pre-filled with required fields and arguments based on the API schema.
- Customize the generated query as needed by adding or modifying fields, arguments, or variables directly in the Query editor.

## Countries GraphQL endpoint

Let's explore the Naruto GraphQL endpoint.

1. Open Hoppscotch, switch to the GraphQL client and connect to the endpoint below:

    ```
    https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql
    ```

2. Explore the schema and documentation to understand more about the endpoint.
3. Look through the Queries section and add the `countries` query to the Query editor. Customize it to filter countries where the name is `"Germany"`.

    ```graphql
    {
      countries (filter: {name: {eq: "Germany"}}) {
        name
        code
        capital
        emoji
        currencies
      }
    }
    ```

4. Click on the run button to execute the query.
5. The query will return the following response.

    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "countries": [
          {
            "name": "Germany",
            "code": "DE",
            "capital": "Berlin",
            "emoji": "ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª",
            "currencies": [
              "EUR"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
